That basically means you can do whatever with it as long as you give me credit for the original and you're not some kind of big corpo-shill. If you make money off my stuff I will be equal parts impressed and angry. But if you make cool stuff off my stuff I'll only be the first one. 

## Everything Else 

The website code and stuff that makes it run is also up for grabs, just don't be weird about it:
